Over the years I have done a number of projects, competitions, and certifications that have all helped grow my cybersecurity knowledge and lead me down the path that I am today. Quite frankly, it all started with a laptop and a foosball table when I was a teenager. Our family got a used foosball table from some sale, and it didn't have a key to retrieve the foosballs, so being a curious teen, I researched how to lockpick on my trust Windows Vista laptop running IE. Eventually, I got a grasp of lockpicking, and managed to open the lock to the foosball table. I was hooked from there. But, I didn't really want to do lockpicking for a living -- yet the idea of breaking into things absolutely *fascinated* me. Fast forward to the end my high school year, I joined a nearby skill center during my senior year, and found potential in my skills in computers and cybersecurity. I started out doing [AFA CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) competitions, and did fairly well for a first-timer, and from there I was hooked on cybersecurity. I then moved on to a different competition through the [Business Professionals of America](https://bpa.org/) where I entered a computer animation competition (I didn't do well there) and a computer security competition, where I excelled at -- eventually making my way to the national competition. From there, I realized cybersecurity was the career path that I had been searching for during my high school life, and started to really pursue it. In the midst of it all though, I learned about a career path that intrigued me the most, and tied everything back together to that foosball table that I picked. There was a career in cybersecurity called penetration testing, where you get **paid to break into things**. 

Oh man. I was hooked from there.

So that's what I've been working towards from then on. I have always had a knack for computers, and a natural curiosity for how things work, so what better way could there be to embrace those qualities? Becoming a penetration tester has been my goal since then, and I have been taking every step and stride that I can to get closer to that goal. I realize how competitive this field is, and honestly, that drives me all the more. I might not have the knowledge now, I might not be a prodigy, but if there's one thing I've learned from embracing the hacker culture, it's this:
Curiosity is the best burning fuel for learning.
