# whitekr0w's Blog
This is my public repository for sharing my experiences with the world. Everything is published publically to [whitekr0w.com](https://whitekr0w.com). The aim for this blog is to help the next guy with my experiences. It's not fun to be clueless, so hopefully at least one thing I write about can help someone.

# Celeste
This blog is based on the [Celeste](https://nicoelayda.github.io/celeste) Jekyll theme. Highly recommend checking it out if you want a nice modern theme for blogging.

Celeste is a lightweight Jekyll theme that features a minimalist, content-first design. It places your content center stage and lets your readers view them in a clutter-free environment without visual distractions. It is based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll butler, by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo).
